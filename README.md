   - **`API_ID`**: Your API ID from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - **`API_HASH`**: Your API Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - **`SESSION_STRING`**: The session string generated using [@SmartUtilBot](https://t.me/SmartUtilBot).

python scr.py

## Usage

The code currently supports the following commands:

1. `/scrmail <username> <amount>` - Scrapes email and password combinations from the specified username/channel.
2. `/scrmail @<username> <amount>` - Scrapes email and password combinations from the specified username/channel.
3. `/scrmail t.me/<username> <amount>` - Scrapes email and password combinations from the specified username/channel.
4. `/scrmail https://t.me/<username> <amount>` - Scrapes email and password combinations from the specified username/channel.
5. `/scrmail https://t.me/+<invite_link> <amount>` - Scrapes email and password combinations from the specified private channel invite link.
6. `/scrmail <chat_id> <amount>` - Scrapes email and password combinations from the specified chat ID.

The command `/mailscr` can be used interchangeably with `/scrmail` for all the above variations.

âœ¨ **Notes**:
- Ensure the bot is an administrator in the channels/groups you want to scrape from for the best results.
- The bot can handle a high number of requests simultaneously, but it's a good practice to monitor its performance and adjust limits if necessary.
- If you encounter any issues, check the bot logs for detailed error messages.
- Keep your API credentials and session string secure to prevent unauthorized access to your bot.
- First Clone Repo Then Update Credentials Dont Direct Commit On Github To  Keep Credentials Secure.
