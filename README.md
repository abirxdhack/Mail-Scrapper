## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- `pyrofork` and `tgcrypto` libraries.
- A Telegram bot token (you can get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram).
- API ID and Hash: You can get these by creating an application on [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
- To Get `SESSION_STRING` Open [@SmartUtilBot](https://t.me/SmartUtilBot). Bot and use /pyro command and then follow all instructions.

## Installation

To install `pyrofork` and `tgcrypto`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyrofork tgcrypto
```

**Note: If you previously installed `pyrogram`, uninstall it before installing `pyrofork`.**

## Configuration

1. Open the `config.py` file in your favorite text editor.
2. Replace the placeholders for `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `SESSION_STRING`, and `BOT_TOKEN` with your actual values:
   - **`API_ID`**: Your API ID from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - **`API_HASH`**: Your API Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - **`SESSION_STRING`**: The session string generated using [@SmartUtilBot](https://t.me/SmartUtilBot).
   - **`BOT_TOKEN`**: The token you obtained from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

3. Optionally, adjust the following settings:
   - **`admin_ids`**: List of admin user IDs who have elevated permissions.
   - **`admin_limit`**: The maximum number of messages admins can scrape in a single request.
   - **`default_limit`**: The maximum number of messages regular users can scrape in a single request.

## Deploy the Bot

```sh
git clone https://github.com/abirxdhack/Mail-Scrapper
cd Mail-Scrapper
python scr.py
```

## Usage

1. Use the `/scrmail` or `/mailscr` command followed by the group or channel username and the number of messages to scrape.

    ```text
    /scrmail @channel_username 1000
    ```

2. The bot will scrape the specified number of messages for email and password combinations and provide the results.

âœ¨ **Notes**:
- Ensure the bot is an administrator in the channels/groups you want to scrape from for the best results.
- The bot can handle a high number of requests simultaneously, but it's a good practice to monitor its performance and adjust limits if necessary.
- If you encounter any issues, check the bot logs for detailed error messages.
- Keep your API credentials and session string secure to prevent unauthorized access to your bot.
